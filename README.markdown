#Monty Hall Problem in Objective-C

[The Monty Hall problem][1] *is a probability puzzle loosely based on the American television game show Let's Make a Deal*. 

##The Problem

The idea is that the contestant will be given three doors, of which two would have goats behind them and the third, a decent prize such as a car. The doors would be numbered ascendingly, and the contestand would be invited to pick one. The presenter, Monty Hall, would then select a door which had concealed behind it, a goat. The contestant would then be offered the ability to switch his chosen door to a different one, increasing his chance by 1/3 of winning the desired prize, a car in this case.

This project is a demo (iOS) of the gameshow, along with the paradox, coded in objective-c, to make it work.
